# 🌟 Machine Learning Specialization - Andrew Ng (Coursera)

This repository contains my handwritten notes and Jupyter Notebooks from the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Andrew Ng, offered through Coursera.

## 🎓 Specialization Overview

The Machine Learning Specialization consists of the following three courses:

1. **📊 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Focus on regression and classification algorithms.

2. **🔍 Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Dive deeper into advanced machine learning algorithms.

3. **🧠 Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learn about clustering, recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course and week, containing:

- 📓 **Handwritten Notes**: Scans or images of handwritten notes covering key concepts from lectures and readings.
- 🖥️ **Jupyter Notebooks**: Practical exercises and coding solutions for the various assignments and projects.
